- Always read the [README.md](mdc:README.md) before starting
- When beginning a new task, always consult with [TRACKER.md](mdc:TRACKER.md) as that is the source of truth for all tickets
- Only move a task to done when the user explicitly says. Feel free to ask if you can move it if you think the task is done.
- If the user does not specify the task at the beginning of the prompt, clarify which task the prompt belongs to
